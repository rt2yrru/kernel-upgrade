Progress

-> Idea into reality started
-->  Coding in python
---> apt plugin added
----> customizing  apt to list all  available kernel


Todo/Partially done

: Directly use ubuntu kernel source
: Parse the ubuntu kernel source 
: Download data based on parsed file
: Install only the relevant kernel 


Issue

: As apt list only safe kernels and not the latest kernel so need an alternative way to list that

example : run --> python 1.py

output will start as : 4.10.x  and not as 4.12 which is the latest
